I don't know about the video streaming yet, but I was able to download some free games from Microsoft store. They show advertising on them though. I don't know if there is a way around it, kind of annoying! Also the keys seem a little smaller than my lenevo thinkpad windows 7, but I think I'll get used to it. What I did when I got online was bookmark the websites I use a lot and are familiar with and also bookmarked google search since I'm not used to using the bing search engine. Doing that allowed me to quickly get to the sites I'm familiar with. I did run into a difficulty with facebook. They wouldn't accept my password for some reason. I messed about with facebook for 3 hours and never could get back into my account. So I finally set up my email with outlook express on this computer and used my middle name instead of first name and managed to set up a new facebook account. Now I'll be able to message my family members again. I don't know what caused the facebook problem but facebook wanted me to send a copy of a photo id and I didn't know how to do that. But with the new account they just set it up and everything went smooth finally. This computer comes with windows 10 s mode. So you have to use Microsoft apps. It can be switched out of S mode, but I probably won't do that on this computer. I'll use this computer for a while but will probably end up going back to HP or Lenovo because this computer just doesn't feel quite up to the quality I was used to. Another thing I noticed is the keys are further from the front of the computer than my old computer. Making me reach further to use them. I find that a little annoying also. The screen is very sharp and nice and it is easy to navigate to the programs. I like that about this computer. I am new to windows 10, but so far I like it. Your Mom can probably get by with this computer the same as me. But how much she'll like it will probably depend on the quality of machine she's used to using.
